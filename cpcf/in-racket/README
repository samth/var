TODO:
* [mostly done] support multiple-argument functions
** properly check function against contract

* [done] precision improvement mentioned in 4.4
* [part] more tests
** [done] length, factorial, insertion sort
** [done] rsa, sat-brute, worst-case, even-worse
** [done] tak, takl, cpstak
** [done] from Wright paper: flatten, taut, member, lastpair, subst*, last
