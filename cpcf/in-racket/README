* TODO
** clean up
** [done] use real Racket contracts instead of comments
** [done] use real sets
** [done] use environment instead of substitution
** [done] use nameless representation for lambdas
** simplify closures (currently having difficulties due to inflexibility from nameless representation)
** [done] proper equality checking
*** I might mess up data cycles by manually recurring through data b/c I need to maintain an accumulator (depth).
** [done] make sure result is consistent with redex model
** [done] measure
