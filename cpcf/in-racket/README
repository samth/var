TODO:
* [mostly done] support multiple-argument functions
** properly check function against contract
** var-args??
* expressions that won't terminate:
** (havoc •) -> (havoc (• •)) -> (havoc (havoc •)): currently solved by discarding kontinuation for havoc b/c it never produces a value anyway. Is this safe?
** (foldl f a •), therefore (reverse •) and (filter p •): currently solved by introducing inaccuracy in cons:
*** (cons (•/{c...}) nil) -> (•/{(cons/c c (listof c))...})
*** (cons (•/{c1...}) (•/{cons/c c2 (listof c2)...})) -> (•/{(cons/c c (listof c))...}∪{cons/c any/c (listof any/c)}), where c ∈ c1 ∩ c2
* [done] precision improvement mentioned in 4.4
* [part] more tests
** [done] length, factorial, insertion sort
** [done] rsa, sat-brute, worst-case, even-worse
** [done] tak, takl, cpstak
** [done] from Wright paper: flatten, taut, member, lastpair, subst*, last
* [part] rewrite eval's loop using mutable hashtables + benchmark
* improve contract checking/proving to get rid of false blames
* clean up
