* TODO:
** no idea what μ does. Is it for making recursive functions?
** type rule for (μ (X T) E) in Appendix A1 seems weird
** type rule for (C ↦  (λ (X T) D)) in Appendix A1 seems messed up: X and T switched, and the type environment on the right of the upper row also needs (X:T) because D is dependent on X?
